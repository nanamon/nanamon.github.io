So I am hoping to revamp my [portfolio website](http://www.nangoo.org) soon. I am actually thinking of putting it on Jekyll. It is currently on Wordpress but I don't know if I need all of the functionality from Wordpress. Plus it would be nice to try something different...

Still, if I do it on Jekyll, I want to find a way to get a thumbnail feed of my portfolio items.

I guess that stuff will come later... and design comes first. Time to get designing. :P
