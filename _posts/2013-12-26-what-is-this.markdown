Hello :)

I was cleaning up all my files after the first few days of working on my new *15" Macbook Pro*. :) And I somehow stumbled upon [Github Pages](http://www.github.com/pages)...

So here I am, writing my first blog post in Markdown, which I also somehow fell in love with for whatever reason.

Let's see how this goes... I've not yet found a purpose for this blog yet but I guess I'll find something for it... eventually.

See you soon, perhaps, or maybe even never again. :x
